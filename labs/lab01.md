## 1.0 Discover Agents from the Marketplace

The Copilot CLI plugin marketplace is a registry of community and first-party agents you can install directly from your terminal. Plugins extend Copilot with specialized capabilities — think of them as pre-built agents for common development tasks.

### Browse available plugins

🖥️ **In your terminal:**

```bash
# List registered marketplaces
copilot plugin marketplace list

# Browse available plugins in a marketplace
copilot plugin marketplace browse awesome-copilot
```

Browse the available plugins and look for ones related to **.NET**, **testing**, or **database management** — these will be most useful for the ContosoUniversity project we'll work with throughout these labs.

### Install a plugin

You can install plugins by name from a marketplace or directly from a GitHub repository:

```bash
# Install from a GitHub repo (most reliable method)
copilot plugin install OWNER/REPO

# Or install from a marketplace by name
copilot plugin install PLUGIN-NAME@awesome-copilot
```

### Verify the installation

```bash
# Confirm the plugin is installed and ready
copilot plugin list
```

You should see your installed plugin listed with its name, version, and source.

### Use the plugin

Once installed, plugins are available in your Copilot conversations. Invoke them by name:

```bash
copilot

# Then in the conversation, reference the plugin:
> @plugin-name help me with my task
```

> 💡 **Key insight:** Marketplace plugins give you a head start for common workflows — but they're just the beginning. In Lab 03, you'll learn to **create your own agents** tailored to your team's specific needs. Think of marketplace plugins as patterns you can study and customize.

> ⚠️ **Offline or marketplace unavailable?** If you can't access the marketplace, skip ahead to [section 1.1](#11-the-configuration-ecosystem). The rest of this lab works entirely with local configuration files.

## 1.1 The Configuration Ecosystem

This repository ships with a rich set of Copilot configurations. Here's the map — the rest of the labs fill it in:

| Directory | What | Count | Lab |
|-----------|------|-------|-----|
| `.github/agents/` | Specialized AI personas (`.agent.md`) | 2 (+ more in Lab 03) | Lab 03 |
| `.github/skills/` | Auto-activating knowledge packs (`SKILL.md`) | 10 | Lab 04 |
| `.github/prompts/` | Reusable command templates (`.prompt.md`) | 21 | Lab 04 |
| `.github/instructions/` | Path-specific rules (`.instructions.md`) | 3 | Lab 02 |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Repository-wide rules (always loaded) | 1 | Lab 02 |
| `AGENTS.md` | Project context (always loaded) | 1 | Lab 02 |
| `.github/hooks/` | Lifecycle guardrails (`default.json`) | 7 | Lab 06 |
| `.copilot/mcp-config.json` | External tool integrations | 5 servers | Lab 05 |
| `.github/workflows/*.md` | Cloud-side AI automation (gh-aw) | 2 | Labs 08-09 |

🖥️ **Quick look — pick any one:**

```bash
# See the agents
ls .github/agents/

# Read one to see the anatomy (YAML frontmatter + markdown body)
cat .github/agents/planner.agent.md
```

## 1.2 The Instruction Hierarchy

Copilot loads configuration in a specific priority order. Understanding this is the single most important concept:

| Priority | Source | When Loaded |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | **Always** — every interaction |
| 2 | `AGENTS.md` | **Always** — every interaction |
| 3 | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | When `applyTo` glob matches files in context |
| 4 | `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | When description matches the conversation topic |
| 5 | Agent profile (`.agent.md`) | When explicitly invoked with `@agent-name` |
| 6 | Prompt (`.prompt.md`) | When invoked with `/prompt-name` |

> 💡 **Key insight:** Instructions cascade and stack. If `copilot-instructions.md` says "use immutable patterns" and `dotnet.instructions.md` says "use async/await", **both** apply when editing `.cs` files.

## 1.3 How Copilot Finds Your Code

Copilot doesn't just do keyword text search — it uses multiple layers of code intelligence:

| Layer | How It Works | Scope |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Semantic indexing** | Builds a meaning-based index of your codebase. Near-instant (seconds). Understands intent, not just keywords. | Local repo |
| **LSP integration** | Interfaces with language servers (TypeScript, C#, Python, etc.) for go-to-definition, hover, references, diagnostics. Use `/lsp` to configure. | Local repo |
| **ripgrep + glob** | Fast pattern-based search for exact matches across files | Local repo |
| **GitHub MCP** | Semantic code search across **any GitHub repo** you have access to — remotely. The agent can scan codebases it's never seen locally. | Remote (GitHub) |

> 💡 When you ask Copilot "how does authentication work in this project?", it's using semantic search — not `grep`. It understands meaning. And with the GitHub MCP server, it can do the same across remote repos.

## 1.4 Try It

🖥️ **In your terminal:**

```bash
# Start Copilot CLI
copilot
```

Then try:
```
@planner How should I add a student search feature to ContosoUniversity?
```

> 💡 Notice how Copilot references the project's architecture, file structure, and conventions — all loaded from the configuration files we just explored. This is semantic search in action.

> 💡 Copilot loads agents from `.github/agents/` in the current working directory. You can also place personal agents in `~/.copilot/agents/`.
