# TDD Command

Enforce test-driven development methodology.

## TDD Cycle

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REPEAT

RED:      Write a failing test
GREEN:    Write minimal code to pass
REFACTOR: Improve code, keep tests passing
REPEAT:   Next feature/scenario
```

## What This Prompt Does

1. **Scaffold Interfaces** - Define types/interfaces first
2. **Generate Tests First** - Write failing tests (RED)
3. **Implement Minimal Code** - Write just enough to pass (GREEN)
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
5. **Verify Coverage** - Ensure 80%+ test coverage

## When to Use

- Implementing new features
- Adding new functions/components
- Fixing bugs (write test that reproduces bug first)
- Refactoring existing code
- Building critical business logic

## Test Types to Include

**Unit Tests** (Function-level):
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases (empty, null, max values)
- Error conditions
- Boundary values

**Integration Tests** (Component-level):
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- External service calls

## Coverage Requirements

- **80% minimum** for all code
- **100% required** for:
  - Financial calculations
  - Authentication logic
  - Security-critical code
  - Core business logic

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Write the test FIRST, before any implementation
- Run tests and verify they FAIL before implementing
- Write minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are green

**DON'T:**
- Write implementation before tests
- Skip running tests after each change
- Write too much code at once
- Test implementation details (test behavior)
