# Instinct Status

Shows all learned instincts with their confidence scores, grouped by domain.

## Usage

```
/instinct-status
/instinct-status --domain code-style
/instinct-status --low-confidence
```

## What to Do

1. Read all instinct files from `~/.copilot/homunculus/instincts/personal/`
2. Read inherited instincts from `~/.copilot/homunculus/instincts/inherited/`
3. Display them grouped by domain with confidence bars

## Output Format
